Place the BebasNeue-Regular.ttf file here.

How to install:
1) Copy your `BebasNeue-Regular.ttf` into this `fonts/` folder.
2) The HTML files already include an @font-face rule referencing `fonts/BebasNeue-Regular.ttf`.
3) Restart/refresh your local server or reload the pages to see the font applied.

If you prefer WOFF/WOFF2, replace the TTF with those files and update the @font-face src formats accordingly.
